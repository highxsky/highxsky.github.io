                    <p>
                        The project is hosted on github: check it out!

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to have my own professional website, to showcase my data projects and share my thoughts on the industry here.
                        I designed it from scratch with HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <div class="separator"></div>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <h3>1 - Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        This was an iterative process. I started by going through a HTML/CSS course and then started building a few web pages, to test different things (mainly flex layout and grid layout).
                        I was not fully satisfied with the results, especially because it wasn't responsive enough.
                        After a while, I decided to rebuild it from scratch and do things differently, and better.
                        <br>I checked a few user experience and web marketing resources and have collected multiple user feedback.
                        I also checked out a few websites that I thought were of good design, for inspiration.
                        Finally, I elaborated a site plan on a canvas and and then started rebuilding my website.
                        
                    </p>
                    <h3>2 - Features</h3>
                    <p>
                        This website is made of 3 components: HTML pages, CSS stylesheet for styling and Javascript code for animations.
                        <br>It was built as mobile first and then adjusted to desktop, for better responsiveness. 
                        Furthermore, web pages have Google tags for analytics purposes.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3 - Hosting</h3>
                    <p>
                        I bought a domain (pierremarionneau.dev) and hosted the website on GitHub, which has the advantage of being free and allow you to use a github domain name or your own.
                    </p>
                    <img id="myImage" src="imgs/Professional website mobile.png" alt="Overview of my professional website on a mobile device" onclick="openModal()">
                    <div id="myModal" class="modal">
                        <span class="close" onclick="closeModal()">&times;</span>
                        <img class="modal-content" id="modalImage">
                        <div id="caption"></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="separator"></div>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        Building a website is in my opinion a great project for aspiring data analysts, because it calls on a lot of useful skills, from web design (HTML, CSS, eventually JavaScript), user experience principes, using Google Analytics, content writing, etc..
                        <br>It is accessible to most, unless you opt for an elaborate design and decide to add a lot of features on your pages. Last but not least, it is rewarding to see your project come to life.
